CHANGELOG FOR AW_LUKAS

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TO DO:
	- Short term 
		+ Debug the langaus fit
		+ Initialize CALIB structure (works without but dunno why)
		+ TMAX programmieren
		+ fix plot_interpol() markers
		+ debug "config file read in" error, where software interprets the -BLA option as config file, even if there is none
	- Long term
		+ Highlight mode for the timing vs energy plot
		+ Plot hists in separate canvases to get more plot control
		+ Build other .h files to get rid of structure and function definitions in the main code 
		+ Implement SiPM saturation correction (see g-2 papers for that), will be done with light pulser studies

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
05/11/2019
	- Different analysis modes available
		+ MULTIS: If multisampling is used, MULTIS does the multisampling calibration
		+ COMICS: Used for calibration of detector, utilizes "column" cut for coincidence evaluation, and "langaus" fit for energy fitting
		+ PULSER: If pulser is connected, fits several superimposed gaussian peaks 


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
05/09/2019
	- All histogram related plots are now also saved in a split screen

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
05/08/2019
	- Input polarity can be read in via the MAPPING in the config file, if input signal is negative, it will be converted to a positive signal for the feature extraction. The plot will still plot the original ploarity
	- Execution time display implemented

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
05/05/2019
	- Implemented the time structure in the signal structure for more clarity

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
04/23/2019
		
	- Implemented costum verbose mode, the runtime output depends on different characters given by the VERBOSE char
		- "p": runtime progress reports
		- "c": config file parameters 
		- "f": fit routine output
		- "h": histogram operation output
		- "e": energy calibration/extraction ouput
		- "t": timing statistics

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
04/14/2019
	- Implemented detector matrix geometry in config file. The MAPPING 2D array has information about the hardware and software channel, if a channel is multisampled, etc..

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
03/12/2019
	- Implemented reading independent energy calibration parameters for the different filter methods, now can be directly copy pasted into config file

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
03/08/2019
	- implemented also time extraction for MWD and TMAX
	- hist_struct
		+ now saves fit parameters as a double_t vector

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
02/12/2019
	- plot_waves
		+ now has "double sample_freq" option to pass the sample frequency of the trace (necessary to get the xaxis right for RAW traces in multisampling mode)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
02/12/2019
	- Langaus fit routine implemented

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
02/11/2019
	- Config file now can be passed as the third command line argument
	- CFD algortithm now includes possiblity to introduce fraction (finally), also implemented as global variable (therefore command line and config file entries)
	- Fast linear fit in interpolation introduced, also plotted in plot_interpol()

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
02/09/2019
	- Major rework of the time structure, introduction of several new structs 	and init functions
	- Including possibility to use configuration file for setting parameters, overwriting all standard settings or command line parsing  
	
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
02/07/2019
	- interpolate()
		+ Adjusted ranges so the global grid stays the same and no time convertion has to be done
		  Only once the sample frequency has to be taken into account
	- print_final_statistics()
		+ Changed acordingly
	- plot_interpol()
		+ Changed acordingly
		+ now gets only two 2D vectors passed including the traces for the interpolated traces


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
02/02/2019
	- main()
		+ Repalced the histogram initialization with new function
	- init_hists(int channels)
		+ Newly implemented
		+ Initializes all needed histograms in the current program mode

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
02/01/2019

	- main()
		+ Filling the histograms now in new fill_hist() function
		+ Added some comments
	- fill_hist()
		+ Newly implemented
		+ Fills histograms respectiong the program mode
	- ectraction()
		+ Added comments
	- multis_calib()
		+ Added comments
