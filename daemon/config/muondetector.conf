# Device path of the serial interface connected to the u-blox GNSS receiver
# for RPI-B & B+ versions, this is usually /dev/ttyAMA0
# for RPi-A+ versions, the hardware uart is routed to the bluetooth chipset and therefore not available for peripheral communication.
# Use the software emulated uart /dev/ttyS0 instead on these devices
# The daemon tries to automatically detect the right one but if this should fail it can be overwritten here.
